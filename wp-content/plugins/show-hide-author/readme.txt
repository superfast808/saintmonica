== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to remove the "by" word? =

If you are unfamiliar with using firebug (or similar debug tools), then send me an email ( m.spyratos@hotmail.com ).
Otherwise, follow these simple steps.

**STEPS**  

1. Locate the `by` word you want to remove, by using firebug.  
2. Find the `class` of the parent container that contains the `by` word and its tag.  
3. Go to the plugin settings, near the bottom of the page and fill-in:

Advanced: Hide the "by" word

The parent classes: `class`  
The regular expressions: `by`

**EXAMPLE**  
Let's say that when you locate the `by` word with firebug, you find this html code:

`<div class="meta-text">
	<span class="meta-author">by </span>
</div>`  
  
Then you should enter:  
  
The parent classes: `meta-text`  
The regular expressions: `by`

*BE CAREFULL*  
This will replace all `by` words inside the `meta-text` class (if more than one exists) and it won't remove the `<span>` tags surrounding `by`.  
So even better use something like this:

The parent classes: `meta-text`  
The regular expressions: `<span class="meta-author">by </span>`

*OR* by using regular expressions.

The parent classes: `meta-text`  
The regular expressions: `<span class="meta-author(.*?)/span>`
